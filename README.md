# Crypto_Assignment
The goal of this project is to create a crypto tracker using React JS that allows users to track the real-time prices and market movements of various cryptocurrencies.
The application will have a dashboard that displays a list of the most popular cryptocurrencies and their current prices. Users will be able to select individual cryptocurrencies to view more detailed information, including market capitalization, volume, and price chart data.
Users will be able to add cryptocurrencies to their watchlist to easily track their movements. The watchlist will have a notification system that alerts users when the price of a tracked cryptocurrency reaches a certain threshold.

Overall, this project aims to provide a convenient and user-friendly platform for individuals to track and stay updated on the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.
